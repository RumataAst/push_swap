Logic

Check argc argv via han_errors functions before creating a struct. 
	this way i don't need to free anything. 
	issue could be when checking for original numbers.
Once it's checked move stack from argv to struct stack A.

Based on the algorithm 







Push_swap_main
In the push_swap_main i have 2 functions (printing stack + get_values_from_argv) + main.

transform_to_stack
Changing from string from user (in push_swap_main) and then transforming to a double circular linked list.

utils
Additional functions to check if stack is in correct order, calculate how many numbers are in stack and free array (not working).

initial_commands 
commands to operate the stack

han_errors
Check if the string consists of numbers.
	  if string has original numbers
