push_swap is an algorithmic project at 42 focused on sorting a stack of integers with the fewest possible moves, using only two stacks and a limited set of operations (sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, and rrr). The project challenges students to design efficient sorting algorithms under these constraints, improving understanding of sorting logic, algorithm optimization, and data structures.

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Implement and optimize sorting algorithms with minimal operations, using the Turk Algorithm
- Manage stack-based data structures and operations
- Analyze and fine-tune algorithms to handle varying data set sizes effectively
