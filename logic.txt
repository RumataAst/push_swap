In the main function push_swap.c - main objective is to get values from the user, check if they are correct (meaning only unique numbers) and
assign these values to the stack.
	Additional functions that i use in order to achive the main objective are:
		-split in ft_split.check
		-checking unique numbers in han_errors.c
*I am using linked lists for the stack because it allows easier manipulation with the stack based on the commands that we can use. For example
changing first and last node.

Second step is to ensure that commands for stack manipulation are working. Which will be done in initial_commands.c

Third step once i have correct stack A and working commands for stack manipulation i can implement algorithm.


TO-DO

CHECK CIRCULAR / DOUBLE LINKED LISTS
Connect libft via make file
Change malloc to calloc
